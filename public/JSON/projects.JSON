    "description": "The WeSplit project addresses a common yet non‑trivial problem: managing shared expenses fairly and transparently within groups. By modelling users, groups, memberships, expenses, and settlements as first‑class entities, and by enforcing role‑based access control (RBAC) at the group level, the system provides a structured way to answer a simple question: “who owes whom, and how much?”. From a functional perspective, WeSplit allows users to create and join multiple groups, record expenses with flexible split methods, and capture settlements that gradually clear outstanding balances. The multi‑tenant design ensures that a single user can participate in several contexts—such as trips, households, or clubs—while holding different roles in each. This, combined with clear balance computation and history views, reduces the friction and ambiguity usually associated with reconciling shared costs.",

By integrating this algorithm into an interactive mobile UI, the app allows users to see the entire compression process: from character frequencies and code generation to encoding, decoding, and ratio calculation. The decoded output always matches the original input, validating lossless compression. Using Expo’s cross-platform libraries simplified file saving and sharing on mobile devices. ",
